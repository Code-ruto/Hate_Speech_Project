The Hate_Speech_Project is the beginning of a bigger project that would use this model in the future as a template to create a more robust machine learning model. This project be aims to develop an NLP-based machine learning model to monitor and manage user-generated content across online platforms. The model will identify hate speech, adapting to evolving language nuances for scalable content moderation.
